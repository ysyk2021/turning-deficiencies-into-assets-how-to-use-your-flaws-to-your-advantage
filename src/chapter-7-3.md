Navigating setbacks and challenges also involves building resilience. Here are some techniques for building resilience:

1. Embrace the challenge: Embrace the challenge and view it as an opportunity to grow and learn.

2. Develop a growth mindset: Develop a growth mindset that focuses on learning and improvement rather than fixed abilities.

Overcoming Common Challenges
